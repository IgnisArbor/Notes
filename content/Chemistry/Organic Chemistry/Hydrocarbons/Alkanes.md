Alkanes are the most simpliest and basic organic molecules consisting of only carbon and hydrogen atoms that all are connected by a **single** covalent bond. Since carbon atoms need 4 electrons to become complete, it'll need 4 **single** bonds to complete its shell. Since each carbon atom is bonded with at least 2 hydrogen atoms and C on the ends, have an extra hydrogen atom (so 2 extra), we can construct a formula for all alkanes:

$$\large \ce{C_nH_{2n+2}}$$

Remember, they are considered saturated due to not having a C=C 

Anyways, let's actually start with the good stuff:

Alkanes can be produced by the addition reaction of hydrogen to an [[Alkenes|Alkene]] or by cracking longer alkane chains. 

## Production of alkanes from addition reactions
- [[Alkenes]] are **unsaturated** organic molecules, meaning they contain a C=C 
- So when hydrogen gas and an alkene are **heated** and pass over a Pt/Ni catalyst
- The hydrogen takes a bond from each carbon in the double bond and saturate the compound to create an alkane
