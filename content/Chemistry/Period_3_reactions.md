I'll be going through important reactions for each element one by one across period 3, make sure to take note of any exceptions or any detail you may find important!

## Sodium (Na)

### Reaction with water
$$ 2Na(s) + 2H_2O(l) \rightarrow 2NaOH(aq) + 2H_2(g) $$ 
*Note: Na reacts vigorously with water, the sodium will melt and move across the surface till it completely reacts, it's important to know that the solution will have a pH = 14 due to NaOH (a strong alkali)" *

### Reaction with oxygen
$$ 4Na(s) + O_2(g) \rightarrow 2Na_2O(s) $$
*Note: Na burns with a yellow flame and the oxide formed is a white solid*

### Reaction with chlorine
$$ \large 2Na(s) + Cl_2(g) \rightarrow 2NaCl(s) $$
