I'll be going through all the reactions of Group 2 metals and any exceptions will in the end!

*X is any group 2 metal unless specified otherwise*

## Group 2 elements

> ### **Reaction with oxygen**
> $$ 2X(s) + O_2(g) \rightarrow 2XO(s) $$
> *Note: all group 2 metals can be burn.t*
> 
> *Note 2: Sr and Ba can also react like so:*
> $$ X(s) + O_2(g) \rightarrow XO_2(s) $$

 | Element | Color when burnt |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Be | White flame |
| Mg | White flame |
 | Ca | red flame | 
 | Sr | red flame |
 | Ba | green flame |

>### **Reaction with water**
>$$ X(s) + 2H_2O(l) \rightarrow X(OH)_2(s) + H_2(g) $$
> *Note: Be **doesn't** react with water at all and Mg **barely** reacts with **liquid** water due to forming an insoluble hydroxide layer immediately when reacting, which stops the water from reaching it. 
>So Mg is usually reacted with steam instead (this will probably hold true for the other metals):*
> $$ Mg(s) + H_2O(g) \rightarrow MgO(s) + H_2(g) $$

>### **Reaction with acids**
> ##### with hydrochloric acid:  
> $$ X(s) + 2HCl(aq) \rightarrow XCl_2(aq) + H_2(g) $$
> *Note: reactions become more vigorous down the group.*
> #### with sulfuric acid:
> $$ X(s) + H_2SO_4(aq) \rightarrow XSO_4(aq) + H_2(g) $$

## Group 2 oxides
>### **Reaction with water**
> $$ XO(s) + H_2O(l) \rightarrow X(OH)_2(aq) $$
> *Note: all of these oxides are basic but BeO is actually [[Amphoteric|amphoteric]]* and that when reacting with water they form an [[Base vs Alkali|alkaline]] solution which become more alkaline down the group.

> ### **Reaction with acids**
> ##### with hydrochloric acid:  
> $$ XO(s) + 2HCl(aq) \rightarrow XCl_2(aq) + H_2O(l) $$
> #### with sulfuric acid:
> $$ XO(s) + H_2SO_4(aq) \rightarrow XSO_4(aq) + H_2O(l) $$
>*Note: the sulfate formed here will be a solid instead an aqueous solution from Ca and below due to its very low solubility*
>
>**Important tip:** *there's no real big difference between the reactions of the group 2 elements or their oxides with these two acids, just remember that the oxygen atom in the oxide will help to produce water instead of just hydrogen gas.*

## Group 2 hydroxides
> ### **Reaction with acids**
> ##### with hydrochloric acid:  
> $$ X(OH)_2(s) + 2HCl(aq) \rightarrow XCl_2(aq) + 2H_2O(l) $$
> #### with sulfuric acid:
> $$ X(OH)_2(s) + H_2SO_4(aq) \rightarrow XSO_4(aq) + 2H_2O(l) $$
>*Note: the sulfate formed here will be a solid instead an aqueous solution from Ca and below due to its very low solubility*
>
>**Important tip:** *quite literally the same reaction as with the oxide except that there's two moles of water this itme, shouldn't be much trouble memorizing all this (same reactions different fonts)*

## Group 2 carbonates
> ### **Reaction with acids**
> ##### with hydrochloric acid:  
> $$ X(OH)_2(s) + 2HCl(aq) \rightarrow XCl_2(aq) + 2H_2O(l) + CO_2(g) $$
> #### with sulfuric acid:
> $$ X(OH)_2(s) + H_2SO_4(aq) \rightarrow XSO_4(aq) + 2H_2O(l) + CO_2(g) $$
> *Note: the sulfate formed here will be a solid instead an aqueous solution from Ca and below due to its very low solubility*
> 
>**Important tip:** *quite literally the same reaction as with the hydroxide, all you must do is add CO2*

This is most if not all the reactions you need to know and as you can see, they're all almost the same with a few expections that aren't hard to follow (please lmk if I'm missing anything)

## Decomposition of group 2 carbonates and nitrates
> ##### heating Group 2 carbonates:
> $$ XCO_3(s) \rightarrow XO(s) + CO_2(g) $$
> *Note: all carbonates and oxides are white solids*
> ##### heating Group 2 nitrates:
> $$ 2X(NO_3)_2(s) \rightarrow 2XO(s) + 4NO_2(g) + O_2(g) $$
> *Note: all nitrates are white solids and that nitrogen dioxide gives off browns fumes*
>
> **Important trend**: As you go down the group, both group 2 carbonates and nitrates become more stable and so more heat is needed to break their bond
